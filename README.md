The **Freya Vivarium Control System Core** is Freya's central, hardware-independent application for advanced climate simulation within a managed environment. It regulates various environmental variables (e.g. lighting, humidity, temperature, ...) according to user-defined settings. By processing sensor data received via its D-Bus interface, the system calculates and sends the necessary instructions to the actuators, also via the D-Bus interface, to maintain the desired conditions. The Core requires hardware-specific components that interface with the physical sensors and actuators.

**Features:**
- Temperature control
- Humidifier control
- Precipitation control
- Lighting control

## API
The Freya Vivarium Control System core uses DBus for interaction with other applications.


| Object        | Method         | Argument                                | Returns      |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------|
| io.freya.Core | setMeasurement | {"variable":"temperature","value":21.4} |              |

The actuator values are emitted by the DBus object.
